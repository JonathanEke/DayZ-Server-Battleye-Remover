# DayZ Server Battleye Remover

Simple program written in c++ to modify the DayZ server exe to disable Battleye<br>
and to allow players with DayZ VAC bans to join your server.<br>
Wrote this so that after each DayZServer update I don't have to manually patch the file<br>
and decided to share it here because why not?

How to use?
<ul>
<li>Drag original DayZServer_x64.exe onto the application</li>
<li>If succesful the DayZServer_x64.exe will now be patched, just start up your server.</li>
</ul>
